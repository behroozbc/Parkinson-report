    This report explores various aspects of speech production and its implications on motor speech disorders, particularly Parkinson’s disease. The study delves into the mechanics of sound production within the human vocal system and the intricate process of speech generation from the mind to the vocal apparatus.
    Furthermore, it examines the impact of Parkinson’s disease on motor speech functions in the brain and the methodologies employed by medical professionals to monitor and compare the speech patterns of Parkinson’s patients.
    Moreover, the report discusses the hypotheses presented in the thesis, reviews prior research that laid the groundwork for this study, and highlights the potential of AI in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of Parkinson’s disease diagnosis and monitoring.
    Through a comprehensive analysis, this report aims to provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between neurological disorders and speech production.
